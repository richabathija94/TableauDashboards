# TableauDashboards
This Repository is all about Tableau. I fiddled with quite a few datasets and figured out a fast way to visualize data from a large dataset. 
## Dataset 1: Quick Overview
This dashboard helps to quickly figure which state has the lowest or the highest profits of a chain of stores located in many countries. It gives a pictorial view of the states of a particular country along with their profits which have been colour coded.

## Dataset 2: Bar Charts
Use Case: Find out which representative succeeded in highest total sales in each region for the bonus to be rewarded.
Note - total sales is not given in the dataset.Calculate it using Tableau.

## Dataset 3: Time Series, Aggregation and Filters.
Use Case: Prepare visualization to find out how the unemployment is changing through the years aggregated on the basis of month of the year and age group. Also add a gender filter to separate on the basis of male vs female.

## Dataset 4: Maps, Joins and Scatterplots
Use Case: Create a pictorial view of the trend of profit margins of Amazing Mart Store across each state in Europe along the years pertaining to each customer. Add the functionality of years as filters.

## Dataset 5: Joining and Blending Data; Dual Axis Charts
Use Case: Show the performance of the company along the years in each category depicting if the target has been achieved or not and if yes then by how much.

## Dataset 6: Advanced dashboards and Story telling
Created a Tableau Dashboard and a Story to give a visual of the customer base of a UK Bank. I customised the Dashboard and the story in such a way that person could get a clear picture of it according to region, distribution by bank balance, distribution by age, gender and age. By hovering on any of the parameters you come to know the respective changes in the other parameters as well.

## Dataset 7: Advanced Data Preparation
This Dataset is about the number of personal vehicles sold in different parts of the world. Using Tableau's Data Interpreter, I first converted the data into a consumable form. Using the Pivot feature of Tableau I then converted the table into a more readable format. Created a Dashboard to give a pictorial representation of the number of vehicles sold in each region as a percentage of the total and number of vehicles sold as per region.

## Dataset 8: Exploring Tableau 10 New Features
**Challenge:** You are a data scientist working for a laundry pick up services startup. This is a relatively small company and cannot compete with the big players in the major cities. The company's strategy is to build a vaast network in smaller cities.

The company already had a strong presence in 140 locations and recently opened stores in 10 new cities. Additionally the company has two separate sales regions. 

You have been assigned two analytics tasks:
1) Identify which of the two sales regions is performing better 
  * AVG Revenue Per City
  * AVG Marketing spend per city
  * AVG ROMI per city (revenue/marketing spend)
2) Identify which of the 10 new locations has the best potential for the company to invest more funds into marketing.
**Solution:** 
* Analyzed data based on region and the revenue generated
* Divided all the regions into two groups based on revenue
* Analyzed the data based on each state and city (level of granularity changes)
* Created a plot of Marketing Spend vs Revenue and labelled each point
* Ran Clustering on the data and gained insights on the clusters thus created
* Added population feature too in the clustering model
**Outcome:** Arrived to the fact that the revenue is directly related to the popuation. The business is heavily customer oriented.
* Ran Linear Regression model on this data
* Created a visualization of only the 10 newly opened stores
**Outcome:** Even though the revenue is high currently the trend line predicts that the top three stores in the blue cluster might not contribute to a higher revenue. On the other hand the stores in the orange cluster did not generate as high revenue as the blue clusters currently, but were predicted greater return than other stores
**My Recommendation:** My Recommendation to the company would be to continue investing in the stores depicted by the orange cluster and completely shut down the store depicted by the pink cluster (as it is clearly running into losses)
