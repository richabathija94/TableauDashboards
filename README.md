This Repository is all about Tableau. I fiddled with quite a few datasets and figured out a fast way to visualize data from a large dataset. 
## Dataset 1: Quick Overview
This dashboard helps to quickly figure which state has the lowest or the highest profits of a chain of stores located in many countries. It gives a pictorial view of the states of a particular country along with their profits which have been colour coded.
